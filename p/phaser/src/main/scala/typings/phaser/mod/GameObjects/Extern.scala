/**
  * An Extern Game Object is a special type of Game Object that allows you to pass
  * rendering off to a 3rd party.
  * 
  * When you create an Extern and place it in the display list of a Scene, the renderer will
  * process the list as usual. When it finds an Extern it will flush the current batch,
  * clear down the pipeline and prepare a transform matrix which your render function can
  * take advantage of, if required.
  * 
  * The WebGL context is then left in a 'clean' state, ready for you to bind your own shaders,
  * or draw to it, whatever you wish to do. This should all take place in the `render` method.
  * The correct way to deploy an Extern object is to create a class that extends it, then
  * override the `render` (and optionally `preUpdate`) methods and pass off control to your
  * 3rd party libraries or custom WebGL code there.
  * 
  * Once you've finished, you should free-up any of your resources.
  * The Extern will then rebind the Phaser pipeline and carry on rendering the display list.
  * 
  * Although this object has lots of properties such as Alpha, Blend Mode and Tint, none of
  * them are used during rendering unless you take advantage of them in your own render code.
