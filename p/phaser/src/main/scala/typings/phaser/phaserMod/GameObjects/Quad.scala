  * A Quad Game Object.
  * 
  * A Quad is a Mesh Game Object pre-configured with two triangles arranged into a rectangle, with a single
  * texture spread across them.
  * 
  * You can manipulate the corner points of the quad via the getters and setters such as `topLeftX`, and also
  * change their alpha and color values. The quad itself can be moved by adjusting the `x` and `y` properties.
