    /**
      * Creates and applies the necessary changes for a given control and state. **Note:**The changes are created
      * in the same order as the objects are passed into the state object attributes. For example, by adding
      * two objects into the `items` attribute of the `oState` object, the first entry is created, and the second
      * entry is created on top of the first change. The item state is applied for each provided object in the
      * given order in the array and uses the provided position. If no index or only an invalid index has been
      * provided, the item is added to the array after the last item in the affected control's item
      * aggregation. In addition the following attributes can be used to remove a state:
      *
      *
      * 	 - `filtered` - Set to `false` in the `filter` scope on condition level to remove one specific condition
      *     for the given key.
      * 	 - `sorted` - Set to `false` in the `sorters` scope to remove a sorter/code>.
      * 	 - `grouped` - Set to `false` in the `groupLevels` scope to remove a grouping.
      * 	 - `visible` - Set to `false` to remove an aggregation item.
      * 	 - `aggregated` - Set to `false` to remove an aggregation.
      *
      * **Note:**To improve the performance, you should avoid additional calls of the controlâ€™s delegate. To
      * do this, the `propertyInfo` property of the relevant control can be enriched with the properties used
      * in the provided state.
