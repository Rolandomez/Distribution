    * Instantiates a Mirror Texture.
    * Mirror texture can be used to simulate the view from a mirror in a scene.
    * It will dynamically be rendered every frame to adapt to the camera point of view.
    * You can then easily use it as a reflectionTexture on a flat surface.
    * In case the surface is not a plane, please consider relying on reflection probes.
